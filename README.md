![hertzianSpace screenshot](screencap.gif?raw=true "Screenshot of hertzianSpace")

hertzianSpace is (will be) a near real-time visualization of the packets that are sent between our mobile devices and WiFi access points to communicate. The first version of this installation premiered at Netherlands Film Festival's BYOB event in the Nicola√Øchurch, Utrecht. The visuals are generated by a C++ program using OpenFrameworks, while the packet sniffing is done using an ESP8266 micro-controller.

<b>This project needs to be placed in an OpenFrameworks folder directly under /apps to work properly!</b>

Right now only the visual part works. Working on the integration with the ESP8266 on a different branch but that's for another time
